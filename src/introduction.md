# Introduction

Before I even start, I should mention that this is a book written by a human being. Its content comes out of my own mind, and if it is not perfect, that should explain it. Maybe one day everything will be AI generated, but not yet and not for me.  
I have used AI for spell checking and styling this book, but nothing more.

It is dedicated to everyone working in this field. The invisible people behind the technologies that bring freedom, privacy, and innovation to our world.

This is a book about crypto, Web3, and cypherpunk ideology. These are things that reshaped the way we think about finance, politics, identity, power, and the internet.

This book views crypto and Web3 as forces that changed our understanding of the world, not as money making strategies. So if you are reading this hoping to make money from cryptocurrencies, you will be greatly disappointed.

But if you are interested in crypto, its origins, and some safety guidance, you might find this book useful.

This book covers the history of cryptocurrencies and the origins of decentralization. It introduces cypherpunk philosophy and explains the role of cryptography in shifting political power. It examines the underlying technologies that support Web3, along with Ethereum and other decentralized infrastructures. It explores privacy in Web3, governance models, and the economic incentives that shape decentralized systems. It also analyzes fraud, scams, and common failure patterns, along with practical guidance on how to stay safe. The final chapters focus on how to reduce dependence on centralized platforms and consider the possible futures of decentralization.

I have tried my best not to make this overly complicated so everyone can understand the concepts. Not everyone wants deep technical breakdowns of mathematics, so please do not treat this as a rigorous academic reference.

The name of this book is No Need to Trust because that is exactly what decentralization changed. We no longer have to rely on authorities with our data, money, identity, or votes. We began relying on systems backed by cryptographic mathematics, which turned out to be far more reliable than human controlled institutions.

Decentralized systems are inherently superior to traditional centralized systems. In any system that involves humans, we can expect things to go wrong, because humans are always the most vulnerable parts of any structure. Centralized systems rely on hierarchies of people, and each level introduces more vulnerability and instability as we move up the chain of authority. The reason is straightforward. Power is corrupt. Anarchists have repeated this for many years, and history has consistently supported the claim.

When you give someone power, which in centralized systems means authority and control over the system, it is reasonable to expect that they will abuse it for their own benefit. That benefit is not always financial. It can be influence, status, or the ability to shape the system according to their own interests. We should not rely on or trust humans to run the foundations of our society. Even if a centralized system happens to have a perfect leader who manages everything with fairness and competence, that person will not live forever. Someone else will eventually take their place, and that successor may not be perfect at all. This makes any centralized system, including governments, unstable, unreliable, and ultimately untrustworthy.

Stripping trust from systems means we no longer rely on human brains filled with chemicals, hormones, and neural pathways that often produce unpredictable and self focused behavior. For now, the most important and effective tools we have are cryptography and mathematics. These tools allow us to remove human reliance from many aspects of society. Some might argue that trust is not being removed but simply shifted from people to cryptographic protocols. While that is technically correct, the comparison is weak. Mathematics does not take sides. It is not self interested. It behaves predictably. Compared to human decision making, this shift in trust is effectively a removal of trust from individuals and a reliance on something far more stable.

I should also mention that this book is not made for profit. It is free in every sense. It is published under the CC BY NC 4.0 license, which means you can read it for free and you are also free to share and modify it as long as you credit the author properly and indicate any changes.

This does not mean I don't like money. So if you want to make donations to support this book, please check the donation page for a list of my cryptocurrency addresses. Donations allow me to spend more time on this work without having to worry about money.
