Before I even start, I should mention that this is a book written by a human being. Its content is coming out of my mind. Maybe one day will come when everything is AI-generated, but not yet, not for me.

I have used AI for the grammar of this book, although I should admit, my own isn't that bad to begin with. This just saves me some time, so I can, instead of focusing on opening my sentences with capital letters or writing my AI in capital case (the first one I wrote was all in lowercase), focus on what I'm writing—an uninterrupted yap.

So with that being out of the way, I will get into introducing the book now.

I am assuming if you are reading this book right now, you probably know what Bitcoin is. But I'll try to explain it anyways.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, meaning it is a digital currency that is built using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and signatures, etc. (I will explain these later on). The beauty of it is not its digitalness or its cryptography, it's that it is truly trustless. There is no entity in the network that you will have to trust (I will get to the hows of this as well, also will get to why not trusting is such an amazing feature to have). Its trustlessnessity (if it's even a word) is what got people into it, is even what got Satoshi to start it.

That was one of the biggest "fuck it" moments in history when Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous developer, or economist, or maybe both, maybe neither of those, maybe a group of people, maybe he or her, invented Bitcoin in 2008.

My unpopular opinion on Bitcoin is that it wasn't that innovative. It was world-changing, for sure, but there have been many, many tries and fails before that—many other examples of people wanting to do the same thing. Satoshi was a genius in putting all the lost pieces of the puzzle together. Satoshi didn't invent every wheel needed to move Bitcoin, and we can all take this page from his book. He built Bitcoin on top of other innovations—the blockchain was there before, hash functions and PoW were there before Bitcoin, the idea of digital cash was there before.

Satoshi built Bitcoin on the shoulders of giants, and he's a legend for it, but he also started a movement. People slowly thought of the world differently because of Bitcoin.

People came up with new ideas to strip the trust from other aspects of society, not just money.

This book is all about that—stripping trust from different aspects of our society. It will look at the technologies we've built so far, kinda technically. I say kinda because I'm not a math teacher nor a cryptographer. I'm just a pseudonymous crypto-anarchist trying to do something, to be honest.

So the book will be highly opinionated and biased because I like crypto, I like the idea of decentralization, etc., and it will be mostly my opinions about decentralized technologies.

Also, this book won't be all about money and finance. Not everything is money and finance. I will try looking at other projects like P2P networks and even dead projects that no one is using.

So I would suggest not seeing this book as a learning reference, as I might go through a lot of useless stuff and yap about them essentially. But if you like cryptography, decentralization, and all that good stuff, you might enjoy reading it before bed or on your lunch break.
